# Determine The law of large numbers
The law of large numbers, in probability and statistics, states that as a sample size grows, its mean gets closer to the average of the whole population. 
This is due to the sample being more representative of the population as the sample become larger.

1. Test the Law Of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with mean = 0, stdev = 1:
2. Create a Python script that will count how many of these number s fall between -1 and 1 and divide
3. You know that E(X) = 68.2% (from Normal Distribution)
4. Check that Mean(XN) -> E(X) as you rer un your scr ipt while increasing N
